# aic bic hq -> the lowest 
# sequential p -> see what is the last significant

gasfur_m <- VAR(gasfur, 6)
# the AR matrix and two s.d. estimate can give you a sense of which is significant

names(gasfur_m)
# phi as the coefficient of AR model
# Sigma as the 

MTSdiag(gasfur_m)
# the residual matrix of eveything

gasfur_mr <- refVAR(gasfur_m, thres = 1.5) 
# thres as t-ratio threshold
# see whether aic drops or rise...if drops, then that's good

gasfur_mpr <- VARpred(gasfur_mr, 4)
# prediction at four 

k1 <- VARpsi(gasfur_mr$Phi)
# calculate the MA psi representation

VARirf(gasfur_mr$Phi, gasfur_mr$Sigma, lag = 24)
# the plot tells you about the MA representation of two time series 
# 1,1, 2,2 => autoregression, 
# 2,1 => second series as input , first as response (no effect, indicating Granger)
# first plot is the everystep impact
# second plot is the accumulative impact

VARchi(gasfur, p =6)
# reconfirm the threshold and zero is okay

GrangerTest(gasfur, p = 6, locInput = c(1))
# the p value here is to see whether to put zero on the first six lag of 1,2 is plausible
# the null hypo is all lag p of 1,2 equals zero
# what we want to find is a high p, not to reject the null
